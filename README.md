### What I learned

For my final exam project, I decided to create a product that is used in the real world. I used a MEAN stack with TypeScript also on the NodeJS+Express back-end, which was new for me. It took some getting used to, but once I got used to it, it was quite nice. 
It was also my first time trying out TailwindCSS which I enjoyed over the usual style of creating classes and defining rules in a seperate file.
